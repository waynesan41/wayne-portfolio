  <h3>
    <strong>Overview</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    &emsp; The Handy Bookmark is a full-stack web application that enables users
    to organize their bookmarks by attaching titles, favicon, descriptions, and
    colorful tags. It also includes a Chrome extension, allowing users to
    seamlessly save bookmarks from any website directly to their account.

  <h3>
    <strong>Features</strong>
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>User Authentication:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Secure login and registration system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for
          authentication.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bookmarking:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users can create, edit, and delete bookmarks and tags. All using
          restful APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Option to categorize bookmarks with custom color tags (e.g., Docker,
          Reading, Food Recipies) and add descriptions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bookmark Database:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A searchable database of bookmarks with tags, titles, and
          descriptions.
        </li>
        <li>Users can submit their tags to attach with bookmarks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chrome Extension:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users can save bookmarks from any webpage by clicking the extension
          icon or using the right-click menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          The extension captures the current web page information such as title,
          favorite icon, and URL, and then sends this information to the popup
          window ready for the user to add tags and a description.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <strong>Technical Implementation</strong>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Front-end:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Built using TypeScript and ReactJS to create a dynamic user interface.
        </li>
        <li>Utilized React Router for navigation between components.</li>
        <li>
          Styled with Tailwind CSS to create dark and light theme options with
          responsiveness to screen sizes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Back-end:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle
          requests for user authentication, bookmarks, and tags management.
        </li>
        <li>
          MongoDB was used to store user data, token sessions, bookmarks data,
          and tags data, with proper indexing in each collection for optimal
          search queries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosting:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Self-hosting on an Ubuntu server running on a $200 home laptop with
          8GB of RAM, secured through a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel.
        </li>
        <li>Using PM2 to manage Node.js</li>
        <li>
          I utilize the Docker compose .yaml file to configure MongoDB for the
          replica set with multiple instances.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chrome Extension:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Created using JavaScript and the Chrome Extension API, allowing users
          to interact with the web app seamlessly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented background scripts to manage local data storage and
          communication with the web app.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosting</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I initially used an AWS EC2 instance for a simpler hosting setup but
          later opted for self-hosting as it is more cost-effective.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>MongoDB</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I use MongoDB Transactions to preserve data consistency and integrity
          when manipulating multiple collections in a single execution. Since
          transactions require multiple replica sets, I utilize Docker to create
          multiple MongoDB instances on a single physical server.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  </h3>

  &emsp; Building this full-stack web app has been an incredible learning
  experience for me. I gained hands-on knowledge in multiple areas of web
  development, from front-end design to back-end logic and server management.
  Exploring the front-end helped me understand the nuances of creating
  responsive, user-friendly interfaces while working on the back-end gave me
  insight into database management, API testing, and security practices. I also
  delved into server management, configuring hosting environments, and ensuring
  a successful deployment. Throughout this process, I discovered many aspects of
  web development that I hadn&rsquo;t encountered before, significantly
  expanding my skill set and deepening my understanding of how the entire stack
  operates together.
