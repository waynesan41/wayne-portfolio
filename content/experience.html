  <h3>Working at a logistics company</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    &emsp; I don't have any formal software engineering experience in a real
    tech company, but I applied my coding skills to create a software
    application that helps me and my team at my current job. This application
    solves real-world problems, automates tasks, and improves workflow
    efficiency.

    &emsp; I also interacted with my team members to gather feedback and make
    improvements to the application, ensuring it met their needs and enhanced
    our overall productivity. While it wasn't done in a tech-focused
    environment, it gave me valuable experience in developing practical
    solutions and collaborating with users.
