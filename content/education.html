  <h3><strong>Computer Science Degree</strong></h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    &emsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to stop attending school due to
    personal and financial challenges.
    <br />
    &emsp;Despite not pursuing a formal degree, I remained dedicated to my
    passion for coding and technology while working a full-time job.

  <h3>My Path</h3>
  <p>
    &emsp;I turned to online resources like Udemy, Linkedin Learning, YouTube,
    and textbooks to teach myself programming, frameworks, and software
    engineering concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;Through this self-driven education, I built projects to deepen my
    understanding of software development, showcasing my adaptability, and
    dedication to any new technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;A major disadvantage of being self-taught is missing out on the
    networking and career opportunities that school offers, such as coaching
    events and professional networking.
