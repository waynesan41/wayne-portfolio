  <h3>
    <strong>Technical Implementation</strong>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Front-end:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Built using TypeScript and ReactJS to create a dynamic user interface.
        </li>
        <li>Utilized React Router for navigation between components.</li>
        <li>
          Styled with Tailwind CSS to create dark and light theme options with
          responsiveness to screen sizes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Back-end:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle
          requests for user authentication, bookmarks, and tags management.
        </li>
        <li>
          MongoDB was used to store user data, token sessions, bookmarks data,
          and tags data, with proper indexing in each collection for optimal
          search queries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosting:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Self-hosting on an Ubuntu server running on a $200 home laptop with
          8GB of RAM, secured through a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel.
        </li>
        <li>Using PM2 to manage Node.js</li>
        <li>
          I utilize the Docker compose .yaml file to configure MongoDB for the
          replica set with multiple instances.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chrome Extension:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Created using JavaScript and the Chrome Extension API, allowing users
          to interact with the web app seamlessly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented background scripts to manage local data storage and
          communication with the web app.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosting</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I initially used an AWS EC2 instance for a simpler hosting setup but
          later opted for self-hosting as it is more cost-effective.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>MongoDB</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I use MongoDB Transactions to preserve data consistency and integrity
          when manipulating multiple collections in a single execution. Since
          transactions require multiple replica sets, I utilize Docker to create
          multiple MongoDB instances on a single physical server.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    &emsp; Building this full-stack web app has been an incredible learning
    experience for me. I gained hands-on knowledge in multiple areas of web
    development, from front-end design to back-end logic and server management.
    Exploring the front-end helped me understand the nuances of creating
    responsive, user-friendly interfaces while working on the back-end gave me
    insight into database management, API testing, and security practices.
    <br />
    &emsp;I also delved into server management, configuring hosting environments
    and ensuring a successful deployment. Throughout this process, I discovered
    many aspects of web hosting that I hadn't encountered before, significantly
    expanding my skill set and deepening my understanding of how the entire
    stack operates together.
