  <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Used <strong>Flutter&rsquo;s </strong><code>Provider</code
        ><strong> package</strong> for efficient state management, ensuring that
        the app remains responsive and updates the UI automatically based on
        changes to the inventory.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Local Database Storage:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Integrated <strong>SQLite</strong> using the
        <code>sqflite</code> package for local data storage, allowing users to
        store food items, descriptions, expiration dates, and image URIs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Image Handling:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implemented <strong>image capture</strong> via the device's camera and
        <strong>image selection</strong> from the gallery using the
        <code> image_picker </code>
        package.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Persistent Theme Switching:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Light and dark theme persistence using
        <code>SharedPreferences</code>, so the user's theme preference is
        remembered even after closing the app.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>State Management</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One of the significant challenges I faced during the development of the
        app was deciding which state management library to use. Flutter offers
        various options, including
        <code>Provider, flutter_bloc, Riverpod</code>, and others. Each library
        has its own strengths and weaknesses, which took additional time to
        research and compare those libraries.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    &emsp; The Food Inventory Tracker demonstrates my ability to build a
    cross-platform mobile application with state management, and local data
    storage solutions. Through features like camera and gallery access and theme
    persistence, I&rsquo;ve created a app that can helps manage groceries items.
    This project showcases my expertise in Flutter development and emphasizes my
    ability to integrate various technologies to create a mobile app. The
    challenge of selecting the right state management solution ultimately
    enhanced my understanding of Flutter.
